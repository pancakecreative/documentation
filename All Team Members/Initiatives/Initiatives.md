Now that we've got that out of the way, let's get down to business (and defeat the Huns).

## Establishing Humanity

### Humans are humans wherever they go
As an employer, you don't get just a machine to do your bidding when you hire a person. An employee is not human capital, they're a complete human, with all the good and amazing and painful and joyful and difficult things that come with humanity. Humans have good days and bad days, and strengths and weaknesses. **And above all, they have inherent value that you must understand and celebrate.** If you're trying to ignore the humanness of humans, you're doing it wrong. Don't do it wrong. Do it right.

	- What do we do when we step on a landmine?
		- Communicate
		- Explain intentions
		- Explain impact
		- Remember that there's probably shame on both sides
		- Apologize
		- Work on forgiving the thing
		- 	If you can (and you have) communicate forgiveness (but don't force it)

## Compensation Plan Initiatives

### Philosphy
While proits are vital to company growth and competitiveness, profits are entirely secondary to employee wellness and overall health. Profits come as a result of the health and wellness and innovation and growth of employees, not at the cost of them. Put in simpler terms, Pancake is built and grown as a result of employees taking ownership and doing the thing (something they can only do when valued and cared for effectively), and not at a personal cost to employees.

### Paid Sick Time

Implemented in August 2018, paid sick time policies are present in Pancake's payroll service.

### Healthcare

As of the writing of this document (September 2018), Pancake was in the process of exploring providing healthcare to employees.

The implementation of healthcare will trigger a wage freeze for the duration of the time it takes for monthly outflows to "catch up" with scheduled raises. This is likely to be a period of 2 3-month reviews, at which point all employees will receive a performance review and corresponding raise on their normal review schedule.

### Market Competitive Rates

Market competitive rates are entirely dependent on revenue and sustainability.

Goal #1 is to get all employees to 25 /hour @ 40 /week (alternatively, salaried equivalent), or 52,000 /year (~58,0000 cost to Pancake).

Goal #2 is to get all employees to 30 /hour @ 40 hours /week, or 57,600 /year (~64,800 cost to Pancake). The same formula as goal #1 applies to this goal.

Raises will be implemented 

In order for Pancake to support these rate in a sustainable way, it needs to make (([yearly cost to Pancake] x [number of employees]) + [shareholder salary] + [expenses]) x 150 percent in gross annual revenue.

For example:

#### Goal 1

```(58,000 x 4 employees) + 45,000 shareholder salary + (4,000 /monthly expense * 12)) = 487,500 annual requirement to support this rate sustainably.```

#### Goal 2

```(64,800 x 4 employees) + 45,000 shareholder salary + (4,000 /monthly expense * 12)) = 528,300 annual requirement to support this rate sustainably.```

Goal #1 and goal #2 are "only" ~50k apart in the above models, and therefore require an extra monthly gross revenue of 4,000. However, they fail to take into account the hiring of additional employees required to support additional growth. A more realistic model is as follows:

```(64,800 x 6 employees) + 45,000 shareholder salary + (5,000 /monthly expense * 12)) = 650,790 annual gross revenue requirement to support this rate sustainably.```


It's unclear at the time of writing this document how these raises will or should be implemented. It seems the most sustainable to raise wages to these goals as the gross revenue of the company grows.

### Profit Sharing

Profit sharing seems like a good way to provide buy-in for employees, and to provide adequate compensation for the profitability of the company. Long term financial impacts of profit sharing are unclear, as are best practices for 
profit sharing. Further research and discussion is required.

### Paid Holidays

This should happen as some point. Pancake needs a solid sales pipeline and a proven monthly gross revenue of three months before we can implement this thing.

#### Proposed paid holidays

- New Yearâ€™s Day
- Memorial Day
- Independence Day
- Labor Day
- Thanksgiving Day
- Christmas Day
- Memorial Day

This is subject to change and discussion.

#### Paid holiday cost

As of the time of the writing of this document (9.12.2018), total cost to Pancake for each holiday would be ~800 /holiday, or 5,600 for the above listed 7 holidays.

### Paid Time Off

Given that gross revenue goals for market competitive rates have been achieved, it seems reasonable we'll be able to PTO as an incidental addition to compensation packages. This assessment requires further research, and should not be considered a promise or contract.

### 401k Plans

401k plans and matching haven't been fully researched at this time, and have no offical trigger. Further research and planning is required to implement 401k plans.
