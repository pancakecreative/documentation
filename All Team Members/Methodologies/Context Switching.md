# Contex Switching

Try not to do it!

## Driving principle
Do one thing at a time!

When we try to do more than one thing at a time, we increase our context switching cost, and create extra work for ourselves. Our principle here is to do one thing at time, whether that's defining a project, sending an email, documenting a feature, writing a unit test, or eating lunch.  

> "People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are."
> ~ Steve Jobs

## Scheduling

It's important to plan the work you'll be doing during the next week. At the end of the week (or at the beginning of the week), make sure to add your expected time slots for each project to which you're assigned to your Pancake calendar.

Make sure to check with the individual charged with client scheduling to ensure you're not missing any projects on which promises have been made to clients.
