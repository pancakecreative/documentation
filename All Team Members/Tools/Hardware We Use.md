# The Tools We Use @ Pancake

## Hardware

### Monitors/Screens

Three or more monitors are proven to increase productivity by up to 33 percent. Interestingly, more than three monitors actually tends to decrease productivity, which it why we aim for three monitors at each station.

The MacBook Pros that we use will only drive up to two displays comfortably, so we use to auxiliary monitors with a laptop display.

#### Primary Screen
For stations with three or more monitors (screens), your primary screen = The thing you're doing, not the thing you're not doing. For stations with only one screen make use of spaces to effectively manage your windows and create context as you're working.

#### Left Auxiliary Screen

For me (John), the primary screen is the left auxiliary monitor. This is the screen where the things actually happen when I'm building something for the web. I keep my browser up in this window so I can see my changes reflected as I fresh and refresh.

#### Right Auxiliary Screen

I use the right auxiliary monitor as a supplemental monitor for my text editor, IDE, or markdown editor. Here's where the writing/coding happens.

I also keep my email client and Slack client up in separate Mac OS spaces on this screen, so that I can reply to the Slacks and the emails when I'm in the appropriate context and role.

> Note: The Right and Left Auxiliary Screens are interchangeable in terms of usefulness. If the right monitor feels better to use as the primary focus, then do that thing. 

#### Laptop Screen

My laptop monitor is the most auxiliary monitor, and I use it to manage my research and references when I'm building. I keep a separate browser window up on this screen, and use it to conduct web searches and manage my time tracking, project management references, and other tertiary tools.

### Keyboard

Stub. Do the thing.

MacBook Pro and Apple Magic Keyboards aren't great for your hands. They force your arms and wrists into an unnatural position, and can lead to RSI injuries over time. Use an external keyboard that's built for ergonomics to prevent repetitive stress injuries.

### External Mouse/Trackpad

While it can feel natural to use the latop touchpad to navigate, the hand postion required to use that is extremely unhealthy and can lead to RSI injuries (feel free to ask John about the physical therapy required by an RSI injury due to overuse of a MacBook Pro touchpad). An external mouse will help to keep your hand in a more natural ergonomic position, which is better for your health and will help to prevent RSI injuries.

### Desk

Use thine standing desk to stand. It's not healty to sit all day, and neither is it healthy to stand all day. Mix it up for best results and you'll be a healthier you!

### Chair

Your chair is super important as well, and should support you adequately and be comfortable to sit in. Please feel free to let someone know if your chair isn't serving you well. Your health is a super concern for the entire team.

### USB Hub

Your desk should be equipped with a powered USB hub for the management of various USB powered devices. If you don't have one, let someone know.

### Webcams

#### Laptop Webcam

Cover your latop webcam for privacy when not in use. No point in providing an attacker with an entry vector into your life when covering said camera is so easy to do. Don't use this webcam for conferences or screencasts unless you're remote and have no access to the external webcam.

#### External Webcam

You should have an external webcam at your station for conference calls and screencast recordings. Use this (not your laptop webcam) for both of these! The quality of the external webcam is better, and the camera angle is more natural for clients and vendors.

The current webcams don't require any software installation, and should just be plug and play. Let someone know if you need help configuring the thing.

#### Power Supply

Your desk should be equipped with an 8-outlet, surge protected power supply. Use this to plug in Pancake equipment. We don't get thunderstorms out here in the PNW very regularly, but we'll be prepped if lightning ever does strike!

#### Battery Backup Units

We don't use these. Because Laptops.

#### Cable-age

You should have the following plugged into your powered USB hub:
- A USB C cable
- A Micro USB cable
- An Apple Thunderbolt cable

These are for the powering and charging of various devices you're likely to use in your every workflows.

#### External Hard Drives

We use external hard drives (with Carbon Copy Cloner) to back up Pancake machines in case of hardware failure. Make sure to plug in your hard drive so Carbon Copy Cloner's backup processes can run!
