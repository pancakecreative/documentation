# Role Description - Chief Executive Officer (CEO) 

## Brief
The CEO has overall responsibility for creating, planning, implementing, and integrating the strategic direction of an organization. This includes responsibility for all components and departments of a business.  As with any level of management in an organization, the CEO's role starts with the fundamental job responsibilities of a manager.[^1]

It is also the responsibility of the CEO to ensure that the organization's leadership maintains constant awareness of both the external and internal competitive landscape, opportunities for expansion, customer base, markets, new industry developments and standards, and so forth.[^1]

Board of Directors
In a typical corporation, the CEO reports to the Board of Directors or in some non-profit settings, such as state government, the CEO may head up an agency or department and report to the office of the governor. The CEO will always serve at the discretion of the Board of Directors.[^1]

The CEO may also own the business, and may have founded the business, so his or her commitment to the business is significant. They may also own a significant portion of the company or its stock. In these cases, a Board of Directors may exist, but its authority is nominal and advisory to the CEO.[^1]

> *Note: Pancake (as of 09.02.2018) does not have a board of directors. The company (corporation?) is owned entirely by the CEO, which creates some confusion and ambiguity. In this respect, Pancake is not a “true” corporation, although it may become such in the future. For the purposes of this document, the board of directors is one and the same as the founder.*
