# Pancake Documentation

Here's where documentation happens.
This documentation is defined in terms of roles, and the responsibilities defined by those roles. Each role has its own directory, which is intended to include a role description, as well as a list of separate documents in Markdown format. These documents should detail processes required to complete tasks or expectations required of the respective role.
